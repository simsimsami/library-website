# what to do right now - what to do in 1-3 hours

- implement table in database (contributors - or the people ) [X]
- get fake data for the table in the database 


# What I have done
- I created a table within the database, called it "contributor".
- I made a get_query request with node.js to get all records in "contributor".
- I made a get_route for the "contributors".
- I made a specific get_route for a single contributor

# What to do next
## to do first
- Create server
- implement get route in server
- test the 2 get routes with postman
- 2 routes work normally (http://localhost:3000/contrib/'{contrib_id}')

- front end allows the user to see some data.
- - publishers
- - users
- - subjects
- - books

## what is happening now

- I need to make it so that the user sees books, its just a list of contributors right now.

----
- Make a HTML page that shows the list of contributors.
- good reads show a list of books, specifically discovery books.
- want a list of books. When I click on it, get more information about it
