# what to do right now - what to do in 1-3 hours

- implement table in database (contributors - or the people ) [X]
- get fake data for the table in the database

## What I have done

- I created a table within the database, called it "contributor".
- I made a get_query request with node.js to get all records in "contributor".
- I made a get_route for the "contributors".
- I made a specific get_route for a single contributor

- Create server
- implement get route in server
- test the 2 get routes with postman
- 2 routes work normally (http://localhost:3000/contrib/'{contrib_id}')

- front end allows the user to see some data.
- - publishers
- - users
- - subjects
- - books

- - made 2 junction tables

- Add assign function.
- - Contributors, contribution roles and books.
